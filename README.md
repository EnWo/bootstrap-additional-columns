# bootstrap-additional-columns

This project adds additional column definitions to the [bootstrap grid system](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/layout/grid/).

Currently the following column definitions are added:
* column definitions for screens larger than 1580px are added with the class prefix .col-xxl-
* column definitions for screens larger than 1780px are added with the class prefix .col-x3l-

## How do I build this?

The minified `bootstrap-additional-columns.min.css` is generated.
